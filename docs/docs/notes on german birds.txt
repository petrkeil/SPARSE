Notes, ideas, and experiences of Clara Rosse, who worked on the database

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	- There is an excel spreadsheet with bird species names 
	at "birds_data_checklists_input_table.xlsx"

Extraction time and effort:
	- To input each study, Clara used the Excel spreadsheed for the data table, 
        prepared the data in there, and when it was ready, copy-pasted it to the "Data"
	table.
	- Simple study (one site, well described, copy-pasteable, not many pages)
	can take half an hour. It does not matter how many sites or species that
	much, it matters more if the content can be easily copy-pasted or transfered
	from the publication to the database.
	- Something like study 16 is horrible - strange data format, many pages. It took 
	at least 3 hours.
	- Some .pdfs have strange font which makes them difficult to copy - Clara
	had to type it, but someone else might be able to copy it.
	- Some redlists are easy, some are horrible (weird formats, ...)
	- A couple of studies had no metadata at all - these are usually fast
	- The work is not very pleasant, it's hard to stay focused, but it's possible
	to listen to music
	- Clara did get more efficient in extracting metadata in the end!
 	- People don't need to be trained ecologists/ornithologists in order
	to do the work, everyone clever can do it
	- For literature search it helped to know that Petr explained to Clara what he was
	looking for exactly, i.e. the kind of questions and longer-term goals that
	Petr wants to pursue with the data
	- Guessing land cover classes from the publications or google maps is not that
	difficult, but it feels a bit "guessy" or "random". 

General notes on the database:

	-UN_ID in data table column Species for unidentified birds

General notes on search:

	-not much old data easiely findable online, need to dig deeper -- the data
	are there, but one needs to follow links, citations, and cues, rather than online
	search results

	-try to search for ornithologists names and stick them 
	into google scholar, that works really well for older data

Online Literature/Data - 
 
	-Atlas der Brutvöel (bundesland) -> seem to be based on large DBs, I cant find them online,
	it might contain exactly what we need. It's basically the books below, digitized, and there may
	even be databases based on them, but we are not sure

	-Hamburger avifaunistische Beiträge https://www.ornithologie-hamburg.de/publikationen/26-hamburger-avifaunistische-beitraege
	This is a journal, could have a lot of papers. Clara didn't go through it.
	
	-http://www.do-g.de/    https://www.springer.com/journal/10336
	Also a journal worth checking.

	-https://www.europeandataportal.eu
	Sounds like it could have what we want, Clara went through it briefly, but
	so far didn't find anyting that interesting. Maybe worth a second look? Maybe?

	-Open Government Data Germany (mostly geografic data)
	Data on everyting, mostly GIS, but there are some birds too. There are some
	strange data formats. 

	-https://www.vogelwelt.com/
	A journal. 

	-http://www.orniberlin.de/index.php/publikationen/obb-1976-90/obb-inhalt (list of literature)
	A list of literature, good, potentially worth exploring.

Books to look for:
	-very many books from many times and areas exist, not sure on the format of lists in them
	there is really A LOT OF THEM, one would need to go to a library, and type them manually
	
	-fischer_2008_literature.pdf in Literature folder contains list of books after 1945 (Table 1) by Bundesland
